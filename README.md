A Sorting Visualizer implemented using Html,css and javascript and Windows Forms Application.

The application visualizes an array of unsorted integers as bars. Each bar has a height corresponding to the value at that position in the array. From here, the array is sorted and the bars indicate movement of the integers within the array throughout the sorting algorithm.

The following algorithms have been implemented into the application:

Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
More algorithms to be added in the future!

Merge Sort


Insertion Sort


Selection Sort


Bubble Sort
